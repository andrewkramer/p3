This site provides users with three helpful web development tools: a Lorum Ipsum text generator, and random user generator, and an xkcd password generator. Each generator displays a random text, user, password based on default parameters when the page is first visited, but users can specify their own parameters for each generator via forms on each page.

The Lorum Ipsum generator lets users define how many Latin words are returned. Sentence and paragraph lengths are randomly determined. The user generator allows users to select how much information is returned per user: Full address or only City and State, and include or exclude phone number. The password generator allows users to select number of words in the password, what kind of spacing character to use between words, how many numbers and/or symbols to include, and number and/or symbol placement.
